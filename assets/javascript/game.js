//Create a random number

//Start game 
    //assign a random number between 18-100 to the number box

    //assign four hidden random numbers between 1-12 to the four crystals

//If the user score exceeds that of the random number, the user loses and the loss counter increments by 1, call game start function

//Or else, if the user score equates to that of the random number, the user wins and the win counter increments by 1, call game start function

//When the user clicks on a crytal, the corresponding value of the crystal is appended to the user's score.

    //Call check winner function
